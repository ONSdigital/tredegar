          <p>The primary objective of this prototype was to build a broad but shallow version of the ONS website that utilises modern web design thinking and allows us to implement the insights we have gained from our user research throughout the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; phase and beyond. </p>

            <p>What do we mean by &lsquo;broad but shallow&rsquo;? We've tried to provide enough content in the prototype to allow some kind of endpoint for the majority of user journeys. This means that there is appropriate content in all of the navigation &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; (we've implemented the taxonomy we previously tested) and a wide spread of content types.</p>

            <p>We have introduced a new approach to search using the open source software, ElasticSearch. This builds upon work we were hoping to implement on the current site and benefits from guidance from experts at independent search consultancy Flax and the Government Digital Service. Again the &lsquo;broad but shallow&rsquo; approach has been important here in ensuring there is enough content to provide realistic search results.</p>
            <p>We know a good search experience is hugely important to you and your <a href="" id="my_feedback" onclick="_bugHerd.win.bugherd.applicationView.anonymousbar.toggleOptions()">feedback</a> on the search solution you'll find here is invaluable in helping us build a search that works for you.</p>

            <p>We've formed a co-located, multidisciplinary team that work in an agile manner and use current best practice in all approaches. The team have made use of &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; infrastructure and has implemented continuous integration and automated testing tools. We've practiced &lsquo;test driven development&rsquo; and are using open source frameworks rather than reinventing the wheel. We were lucky enough to have been given the freedom to take an almost &lsquo;lean startup&rsquo; approach and hopefully we've made the most of the learning opportunities.</p>
