The ONS collects data from many sources such as businesses, manufacturers and service providers so that it can produce statistics on things such as GDP and indices of services, manufacturing and production.",
,Environmental accounts,,"Environmental Accounts show the relationship between the environment and the economy. This is done by outlining how the environment contributes to the economy (e.g. through the extraction of raw materials), the impact the economy has on the environment (e.g. through energy consumption) and how society responds to environmental issues (e.g. through expenditure on environmental protection). These accounts are used to inform government policies and to evaluate the impact that different sectors have on the environment.",

,,Earnings and working hours,"Earnings are the reward for work and they can be paid on a regular basis or as bonus pay. Total pay combines both regular and bonus pay. The Office for National Statistics reports the level and growth rate of average weekly total, regular and bonus pay. Working hours are given as the average weekly hours worked by full-time and part-time workers.",
,,Labour productivity,"Labour productivity measures the efficiency of the workforce. It is calculated as output per worker, output per job and output per hour. Labour productivity is an important factor in determining the productive potential of the economy. Countries with strong labour productivity growth tend to benefit from high rates of growth and low inflation. ",
,,Workplace disputes and working conditions,Workplace disputes refer to stoppages of work related to a dispute between employer and employees. These include strikes (lawful and unlawful) and 'lock outs'  (an employer barring employees from entering a place of work).

,"Births, deaths and marriages",,"Births, deaths and marriages or ‘life event’ statistics allow us to have a better understanding of the size and condition of the population.  The number of births and deaths affect the size of the usual resident population.  Definitive data on the number of births and deaths are published on a calendar year basis, whereas data for updating population estimates use mid-year to mid-year (1 July to 30 June) data, with some other minor differences. ",
,,Live births,"Statistics on live births are a subset of numbers from the data that the ONS obtains from the births and deaths registrations. They are available by sex, month of the year and region of the UK. ",
,,Deaths,"ONS receives data on deaths from the deaths register. This means only data on registered deaths is available. This data is available by age, sex, area of the UK and cause of death. Some of the datasets here are available as long run time series. ",

They also provide ageing indicators such as median age and sex ratios at older ages at the national and local level.",
,,Conception and fertility rates,Conception statistics bring together records of birth registrations and abortion notifications. Fertility analysis adds value to information published on births by reporting statistics on those with no children and fertility among women born inside and outside the UK. Fertility projections are also used in the population projections. ,
,,Families,"Statistics on families add value to the information published on marriages, divorces and civil partnerships, including analysis of children living in lone parent families, the number of married couples versus cohabiting couples, and young adults living with their parents. These statistics can be used to guide government policies and are of general interest to the public. ",
,,Maternities,"A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children, including stillbirths.

,,Population projections,"National population projections are available by age and sex for the UK and its constituent countries. These population projections are based on mid-year population estimates and a set of underlying assumptions regarding future fertility, mortality and migration. They provide an indication of the impact that changes in demographic patterns might have on the size and age structure of the population in the future. These projections are widely used for resource allocation and planning. ",

The data here is collected from a sample of mortgage completions and therefore does not include houses sold to cash buyers. ,
,Personal and household finances,,"Statistics on personal and household finances help us build a picture of how people in the UK are funding their lifestyles. Key statistics here are on household and personal debt, expenditure, income and wealth.",
,,Debt,"Debt statistics found here focus on debt levels for people and households. These statistics come from the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS). They tell us about financial debt, which includes credit and store cards that are not settled each month, overdrafts and all forms of fixed term loans.

Also available is data on how people feel about their level of debt.  ",
,,Expenditure,"Household expenditure data can be broken down into twelve key headline areas, ranging from housing, fuel and power to clothing and footwear and alcoholic drinks, tobacco and narcotics. This data comes from the Living Costs and Food survey (LCF) which asks a sample of households to keep a diary of their costs over a period of time. This data gives us a headline figure of average weekly household spending.",
,,Income and wealth,"Income and wealth are different because while income is a flow of money such as your monthly earnings, wealth is not a flow, it is a stock of assets such as shares in a company or property.
