  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

      "markdown": "This bulletin contains detailed public sector employment estimates, including new estimates for Q1 2014. For most sources that contribute to these statistics, the employment is reported for a specific day in March 2014. The public sector comprises central government, local government and public corporations as defined for the UK National Accounts.\n\nEstimates of public sector employment are provided on a headcount and full-time equivalent (FTE) basis for sectors and industries, and also by region on a headcount basis only. In addition, Civil Service employment is provided by government department and agency. Employment in Executive Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) has been aggregated by sponsoring department. Since 2009, some financial institutions have been classified to the public sector. English further education colleges and sixth form college corporations have been classified to the private sector with effect from 1 April 2012. Estimates of public sector employment excluding effects of major reclassifications have also been provided.\n\nEstimates of private sector employment are provided. These are derived as the difference between Labour Force Survey estimates of employment in the whole economy and the public sector estimates collected from public sector organisations.\n\nAs part of this release, revisions have been made to the series in line with the revisions policy for Public Sector Employment (see background note 3).\n\nThe main uses of these statistics are in monitoring changes in the number of people employed in the public and private sector in the UK. They are the official measure of UK public sector employment.\n"

There were 5.4 million people employed in the public sector at Q1 2014, 14.7% lower than the peak level seen in Q3 2009. The main reason for this fall is the reclassification, from the public sector to the private sector, of further education and sixth form colleges in England in April 2012, of the Royal Mail in October 2013, and of Lloyds Banking Group in March 2014.\nThe number of people employed in the private sector in Q1 2014 is estimated to be 25.1 million.  Around four in five people who are working are employed in the private sector.\n\nThere was a fall in employment in local government and increase in central government employment, which can still be attributed to schools in England continuing to become academies. Employment in public corporations decreased due to the reclassification of Lloyds Banking Group from the public sector to the private sector. Employment in the Civil Service in Great Britain decreased mainly due to reductions in employment in the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majestyâ€™s Revenue \u0026 Customs.\n"

This decrease is mostly explained by the reclassification of Lloyds Banking Group from the public sector into the private sector.\n\nIn the year to Q1 2014, UK PSE fell by 280,000 headcount (4.9%) and 249,000 FTE (5.3%).  This decrease is mainly explained by the reclassification of Royal Mail plc in Q4 2013 and Lloyds Banking Group in Q1 2014, both from the public sector into the private sector.\n\nWithout the effects of the major reclassifications, public sector employment would have fallen by 11,000 (0.2%) on the previous quarter and by 16,000 (0.3%) on the same quarter a year ago, both on a headcount basis.\n\nFigure 1 shows how total UK PSE has fallen each quarter from 2009 Q3 except for a flat movement into 2013 Q3.\n\nIn Q2 2012, English further education colleges and sixth form college corporations were reclassified from the public sector to the private sector (see background note 8 for further details). This resulted in the movement, from the public sector to the private sector, of an estimated employment (on a headcount basis) of 196,000.\n#### Figure 2: UK Public Sector Employment in Civil Service and Public Corporations, Q1 1999 to Q1 2014, seasonally adjusted\n[![Figure 2: UK Public Sector Employment in Civil Service and Public Corporations, Q1 1999 to Q1 2014, seasonally adjusted](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig2pcsandcs_tcm77-361719.png)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig2pcsandcs_tcm77-361719.png \"Figure 2: UK Public Sector Employment in Civil Service and Public Corporations, Q1 1999 to Q1 2014, seasonally adjusted\")\n\nSource: Quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Notes:\n1.

The decrease in Q1 2014 is caused by the reclassification of Lloyds Banking Group from the public sector into the private sector in March 2014.\n\nIn the year to Q1 2014, the headcount in UK public corporations fell by 273,000 (58.7%) and the FTE by 249,000 (57.9%).\n\nThe Q1 2014 levels of headcount (192,000) and FTE (181,000) are at their lowest recorded values (measurement has been carried out on a consistent basis since 1999). Figure 2 charts the profile of UK public corporations employment from the start of 1999 to Q1 2014.\n\n### Civil Service\n\nAt Q1 2014, Civil Service employment was 439,000 on a headcount basis and 405,000 on a FTE basis. This is down by 6,000 (1.3%) on headcount and 6,000 (1.5%) on a FTE basis compared with Q4 2013.\n\nIn the year to Q1 2014, employment in the Civil Service has fallen by 10,000 (2.2%) on a headcount basis, and by 9,000 (2.2%) on a FTE basis. Figure 2 shows the downward trend in Civil Service employment since Q2 2005, when it was at its highest level of 571,000 on a headcount basis.\n\n### Factors Affecting Employment in Local and Central Government\n\nThere is an ongoing shift of employment from local government to central government, as a result of local authority maintained schools converting to academy status. Academies are classified to central government, whereas local authority maintained schools are classified to local government. As a result, whenever a local authority maintained school becomes an academy, its employees move from local government to central government.\n\nBetween Q4 2013 and Q1 2014, a headcount of approximately 10,000 and a FTE of approximately 7,000 transferred from local government to central government due to academy conversions. In the year to Q1 2014, this had caused a headcount of approximately 67,000 and FTE of approximately 51,000 to move from local to central government.\n\nIn Q2 2012, the reclassification of English further education colleges resulted in the transfer of employees from central government to the private sector, with an approximate headcount of 176,000. At the same time the reclassification of English sixth form college corporations resulted in the transfer of employees from local government to the private sector, with an approximate headcount of 20,000.\n\n#### Figure 3: UK Public Sector Employment in Local and Central Government, Q1 1999 to Q1 2014, seasonally adjusted\n[![Figure 3: UK Public Sector Employment in Local and Central Government, Q1 1999 to Q1 2014, seasonally adjusted](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig3localandcentral_tcm77-361730.png)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig3localandcentral_tcm77-361730.png \"Figure 3: UK Public Sector Employment in Local and Central Government, Q1 1999 to Q1 2014, seasonally adjusted\")\n\nSource: Quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Notes:\n1. The Academies Act 2010 was passed in July 2010. This has resulted in local authority maintained schools taking on academy status. Local authority maintained schools are classified to local government, and academies to central government. As a result, when a local authority maintained school takes on academy status, its employment moves from local to central government.\n2. English further education colleges classified to central government from 1993 to 31 March 2012. They are therefore included in central government estimates from 1993 to Q1 2012, but not in subsequent quarters. See background note 8.\n3. English sixth form college corporations classified to local government from 1993 to 31 March 2012. They are therefore included in local government estimates from 1993 to Q1 2012, but not in subsequent quarters.

This can mostly be accounted for by academy conversions during the year, and the abolition of the regional Scottish police and fire service bodies.\n\nThe decreasing trend in local government employment since Q2 2010 can be seen in Figure 3.\n\n### Central Government\n\nAt Q1 2014, employment in central government increased when compared with Q4 2013, by 14,000 (0.5%) on a headcount basis, and by 11,000 (0.4%) on a FTE basis. This is mainly accounted for by academy conversions.\n\nThe Q1 2014 central government headcount estimate was 91,000 (3.3%) higher, and the FTE estimate 75,000 (3.1%) higher, than the respective estimates at Q1 2013. This can again be mainly explained by academy conversions during the period, and the establishment of the central Scottish police and fire service bodies.\n\nFigure 3 shows how employment in central government has steadily risen following the passing of the Academies Act 2010, once the temporary effects of the reclassification of English further education colleges and sixth form college corporations in Q2 2012 have been removed.\n"

      "markdown": "###** 1. Basic Quality Information**\n\nIn 2005 the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in collaboration with other government departments and the devolved administrations, implemented major improvements to public sector employment (PSE) estimates. Standard definitions for public sector employment across all departmental statistics were agreed and a single definitive set of quarterly PSE estimates introduced. A new Quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey (QPSES) was established. ONS publishes official PSE estimates each quarter as National Statistics, in the form of a Statistical Bulletin, approximately 11 weeks after the period to which they refer.\n\nFurther details can be found in the [Quality and Methodology Information for Public Sector Employment (115.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/labour-market/quality-and-methodology-information-for-public-sector-employment--pse-.pdf \"Quality and Methodology Information for Public Sector Employment (PSE)\") article.\n\n###** 2. Relevance to Users**\n\nThe public sector comprises central government, local government and public corporations as defined for the UK National Accounts. ONS produces the United Kingdomâ€™s National Accounts. The National Accounts are an internationally comparable accounting framework that describes the activities in a national economy. The relevant international manuals are the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93) and the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). As part of the process of producing the National Accounts, ONS decides on the classification of institutions and transactions within the economy using the [current UK classification process (81.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/na-classifications/the-ons-classification-process/uk-national-accounts-sector-and-transaction-classification.pdf \"UK National Accounts Sector and transaction classification\") .\n\nThe [Public Sector Classification Guide](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/na-classification/national-accounts-sector-classification/index.html \"Public Sector Classification Guide\") is published monthly by ONS, and provides information on the classification of organisations and institutions in the National Accounts.\n\nThe public sector employment estimates relate to the number of people employed according to returns from relevant organisations, but they include a number of workers with a second job in the public sector whose main job is in the private sector or in a separate public sector organisation. The private sector estimate, which is obtained by taking the difference between the Labour Force Survey estimate of people employed in the whole economy and the public sector total, will thus tend to be correspondingly understated by a small percentage.\n\nHeadcount estimates are based on the number of employees with an employment contract who are being paid by the organisation. Employees can be permanent, on a fixed-term contract or employed on a casual basis. Self-employed, contract workers and agency workers are excluded.\n\nPermanent employees, as defined in Tables 8 and 10, are employees with a contract with no agreed expiry date or a fixed term contract of more than 12 months. Temporary/casual employees are those with a fixed term contract of 12 months or less or employed on a casual basis.\n\nAs well as the headcount estimates, estimates have also been produced for the number of employees in full-time equivalents (FTE) back to 1999. This is based on converting part-time employeesâ€™ hours into a full-time employeesâ€™ equivalent and provides a better indication of total labour input than a simple headcount.\n\n###** 3. Common Pitfalls in Interpreting Series**\n\nEstimates of public sector employment for Q4 2013 to Q1 2014 are based partly on projections for some sources. As part of the development programme to improve the quality of public sector employment estimates, public sector organisations are working towards the production of timely quarterly estimates. Until this development programme is completed, there remains a requirement to include estimates for certain sources:\n\n1. Police (including civilians) workforce estimates for England and Wales are published every six months (for two quarters) by the Home Office.\n2. NHS workforce statistics for England are derived from a pay system which covers all but two English NHS organisations. This produces very good estimates of staff numbers. Figures for the two other organisations are estimated based on annual NHS Workforce Census figures. This new source of estimates will reduce the need to revise estimates in the future.\n\nThe Home Office has provided estimates for the Police in England and Wales. These estimates are based on projections and may be subject to revision.\n\nAll time series in the Public Sector Employment release, except for the regional series, are seasonally adjusted to aid interpretation. As seasonal adjustment does not preserve additivity within aggregation structures, relationships that hold in the unadjusted series do not necessarily hold for the seasonally adjusted series. For example, total public sector employment equals the sum total of all public sector industry estimates before seasonal adjustment, but this is not necessarily true after seasonal adjustment.\n\nPublic sector employment statistics have previously been published for periods up to and including Q4 2013. In line with the published [revisions policy for public sector employment statistics (26.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/public-sector-employment/public-sector-employment-statistics-revisions-policy.pdf \"Public Sector Employment Statistics Revision Policy\") , the statistics have been revised, to take account of late information from respondents.\n\nTables 1R to 5R illustrate the size of the revisions in each category.\n\n###** 4. Concepts and Definitions**\n\nCentral government includes all administrative departments of government and other central agencies and Non-Departmental Public Bodies. As such it is wider than the Civil Service. This sector also includes HM Forces and the National Health Service (NHS). Within education, academies and free schools are classified to central government. From 1 April 2005, central government includes the former Magistrates\u0027 Courts Service which has been brought together with the Court Service to form Her Majesty\u0027s Courts Service. The Magistrates\u0027 Courts Service was previously classified to local government.\n\nLocal government covers those types of public administration that only cover a locality and any bodies controlled and mainly financed by them. The sub-sector includes all areas of administrative authorities including parish councils, though these units are not covered by the current estimates for local authorities. It includes police forces and their civilian staff. All functions of local authorities are classified to the sub-sector, although trading activities that produce market output (for example, housing and municipally owned markets) are regarded as quasi-corporations and appear under public corporations. Local education authorities are part of local government, as are voluntary aided schools, county schools and, from September 1999, foundation schools (formerly grant-maintained).\n\nPublic corporations are companies or quasi-corporations controlled by government, for example London Underground Ltd. These companies receive more than half their income from sales of goods or services into the market place.\n\nThe estimates of Civil Service employees count all home Civil Service employees (including from 1 April 2005 the employees of the former Magistrates\u0027 Courts Service). Civil Service employees can be classified to central government or public corporations. Examples of public corporations include the UK Intellectual Property Office and the Driving Standards Agency. Civil Service estimates exclude the Northern Ireland Civil Service and other Crown servants. Employees in these groups are included in estimates of central government employment.\n\n###** 5. Accuracy**\n\n#### Response Rates:\n\nPSE statistics are compiled from a range of sources. The primary source is the Quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey (QPSES). The QPSES comprises three separate data collections; the home Civil Service, Local Authorities in England and Wales, and Great Britain public corporations and Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs). Returned questionnaires go through a series of automated validation tests to check for completeness and consistency and to identify any significant movements compared with the previous period reported (and the same period the previous year). The automated checks are followed up with respondents where errors are detected or further explanation is required. The target is to clear 95% of test failures prior to processing results. ONS targets for response to each of the three surveys ahead of compiling results are 85% (number of respondents) and 90% (of total employment). In addition, each survey has a list of critical respondents (usually those with the largest employment) for which special efforts are made to achieve 100% response and clearance of test failures.\n\n#### Table 1: Response Rates for Sources of Public Sector Employment, Q1 2014\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table:\n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/q1-2014/chd-pse-fig-9.xls \"XLS format\") (27 Kb)\n\nData for non-responders are imputed based on previous returns and known annual changes in seasonality. It is extremely rare for a local authority, public body or Civil Service department to non-respond for two consecutive quarters. The data collection is statutory for local authorities and public bodies (Statistics of Trade Act 1947) and positive action is taken to address non-response issues as and when they occur.\n\nSo that estimates of total public sector employment can be made, it is necessary for further information to be gathered from external sources.\n\n#### Table 2: External Sources of Data for Public Sector Employment Statistics\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table:\n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/q1-2014/prt-pse-tab--2-.xls \"XLS format\") (28 Kb)\n\nONS is now able to produce regional estimates of PSE based on returns from public sector organisations (Table 6). These supersede those produced using the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which previously had been used in conjunction with national PSE estimates to produce estimates by region.\n\n###** 6. Future Revisions**\n\nStatistics for the NHS for England for Q4 2007 onwards are partly based on projections and informed modelled estimates have been supplied by the Information Centre for Health and Social Care. These estimates may be revised following the publication of the annual NHS workforce statistics.\n\nStatistics for the Police (including civilians) for Q4 2007 onwards for England and Wales are based partly on projections supplied by the Home Office. These estimates may be revised following the publication of the latest Home Office statistics.\n\nDue to ongoing validation of data from the new HM Forces Personnel Administration System, figures for Q2 2007 onwards are provisional and subject to review.\n\n###** 7. Coherence**\n\nThe estimates of public sector employment in education (SIC division 85) differ from the school workforce estimates published by the Department for Education (DfE) (formerly Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF)) mainly as a result of differences in coverage and data sources. DfE estimates focus on the number of FTE teachers and support staff for England only. By comparison, the ONS estimates are derived by allocating local authority employees to education using the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) and the QPSES in England and Wales. The DfE School Workforce Census school level estimates are used to estimate employment in academies in England. PSE estimates include all employees reported by local authorities as working in primary, secondary and adult education establishments including some groups who are not covered by the DfE statistics, such as adult education staff and certain categories of support staff. Employment estimates for education in Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included to give a wider UK coverage. The different coverage of the ONS and DfE education statistics serve the needs of different users. Those who require information on the workforce in England who are directly involved in pupils\u0027 teaching and learning should use DfE published statistics. Users should also refer to DfE published statistics to gauge trends in education employment. Those who seek data on UK public sector employment in education, in its widest sense, should use the ONS data in this release. For further information on the differences between DfE and ONS data on education please see pages 44 to 46 of the [Public Sector Employment Trends 2005 (463 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/public-sector-employment/public-sector-employment-trends-2005.pdf \"Public Sector Employment Trends 2005\") article published in October 2005.\n\nONS estimates for the NHS also differ from the headline figure produced by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Again, this reflects the wider UK coverage (HSCIC figures are for England only) plus the exclusion by ONS of general practitioners (GPs). ONS, in accordance with National Accounts practice, classifies GPs as part of the private sector. ONS also include â€˜hospital practitioners and clinical assistantsâ€™ who work in hospitals on a salaried pay scale but generally work as GPs leading the HSCIC to exclude them from their totals to avoid double counting. When these factors are allowed for, ONS and NHS data can be shown to be identical.\n\nSector classification and machinery of government changes in the period since 31 March 2013 are listed here:\n\n#### Table 3: Sector Classification and Machinery of Government Changes, 1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table:\n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/q1-2014/prt-pse-tab--3-.xls \"XLS format\") (27.5 Kb)\n\n###** 8. Further Education Colleges**\n\nOn 13 October 2010, ONS announced the reclassification of further education colleges and sixth form college corporations to the public sector. ONS, as part of the Q4 2010 publication, took on employment estimates for further education colleges back to 1993 or their inception if later.\n\nOn 31 May 2012, ONS announced the reclassification of English further education colleges and sixth form college corporations to the private sector, as Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH), effective from 1 April 2012. As such, employment estimates for English further education colleges and sixth form college corporations are included in ONS estimates of public sector employment from 1993 or their inception if later, up to and including Q1 2012. English further education colleges and English sixth form college corporations estimates of employment are not included in public sector employment estimates from Q2 2012 onwards. More information on this decision can be found in the [Reclassification of Further Education Corporations and Sixth Form Colleges in England](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/na-classification/national-accounts-sector-classification/classification-update---may-2012/reclassification-of-further-education-corporations-and-sixth-form-colleges-in-england---article.html \"Reclassification of Further Education Corporations and Sixth Form Colleges in England\") article published on 31 May 2012.\n\n###** 9. The Census**\n\nThe Census is a count of the population in the UK. It takes place every 10 years and asks everyone the same questions to give a complete picture of the nation. This information is used to estimate the likely number of people and households in each area for the next 10 years. The ONS designs, manages and runs the census in England and Wales. The General Register Office Scotland (GROS) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) are responsible for the census in Scotland and Northern Ireland. All three agreed to conduct their 2011 censuses on the same day (27 March 2011) in order to produce consistent and coherent information that covers the whole of the UK. The Census generated approximately 40,000 temporary public sector jobs across the UK, covering a range of part-time and full-time roles.\n\nThe number of people in public sector employment was 6.102 million at Q2 2011, a decrease of 94,000 compared with Q1 2011. The estimate for Q1 2011 includes 15,000 people employed on a temporary basis in connection with the 2011 Census, but there were only 1,000 people employed in these temporary jobs at Q2 2011. Excluding people employed in temporary Census posts, the fall in public sector employment between Q1 and Q2 2011 was 80,000.\n\n###** 10. Coverage of Academies in England**\n\nImprovements to the way employment in public sector education in England is estimated were first implemented as part of the PSE, Q3 2012 release. Revisions to the estimates caused by these improvements were at that time incorporated into the revised PSE series, in line with the [revisions policy for public sector employment statistics (26.4 Kb Pdf)]\n(http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/public-sector-employment/public-sector-employment-statistics-revisions-policy.pdf \"Public Sector Employment Statistics Revisions Policy\").
