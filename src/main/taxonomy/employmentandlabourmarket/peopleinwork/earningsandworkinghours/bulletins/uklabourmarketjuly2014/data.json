  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

The employment estimates include all people in work including those working part-time. People not working are classed as unemployed if they have been looking for work within the last four weeks and are able to start work within the next two weeks. A common misconception is that the unemployment statistics are a count of people on benefits; this is not the case and they include unemployed people not claiming benefits.\n\nJobless people who have not been looking for work within the last four weeks or who are unable to start work within the next two weeks are classed as economically inactive. Examples of economically inactive people include people not looking for work because they are students, looking after the family or home, because of illness or disability or because they have retired.\n\n### Making comparisons with earlier data\n\nThe most robust estimates of short-term movements in the labour market are obtained by comparing the [estimates for March to May 2014 with the estimates for December 2013 to February 2014](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/april-2014/statistical-bulletin.html \"estimates for March to May 2014 with the estimates for December 2013 to February 2014\") first published on 16 April 2014. This provides a more robust estimate than comparing with the [estimates for February to April 2014](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/june-2014/statistical-bulletin.html \"estimates for February to April 2014\") published last month in the previous edition of this Statistical Bulletin. This is because the March and April data are included within both estimates, so effectively observed differences are those between the individual months of February and May 2014. The Labour Force Survey, from which these estimates are derived, is sampled such that it is representative of the UK population over a three month period, not for single month periods.\n\n### Accuracy and reliability of survey estimates\n\nMost of the figures in this Statistical Bulletin come from surveys of households or businesses. Surveys gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population. The sample is designed carefully to allow for this, and to be as accurate as possible given practical limitations such as time and cost constraints, but results from sample surveys are always estimates, not precise figures. This means that they are subject to a margin of error which can have an impact on how changes in the numbers should be interpreted, especially in the short-term.\n\nChanges in the numbers reported in this Statistical Bulletin (and especially the rates) between three month periods are usually not greater than the margin of error.  In practice, this means that small, short-term movements in reported rates (for example within +/- 0.3 percentage points) should be treated as indicative, and considered alongside medium and long-term patterns in the series and corresponding movements in administrative sources, where available, to give a fuller picture.\n\nFurther information is available in the **Accuracy of the Statistics: Estimating and Reporting Uncertainty** section of this Statistical Bulletin.\n\n### Seasonal adjustment\n\nAll estimates discussed in this Statistical Bulletin are seasonally adjusted except where otherwise stated. Like many economic indicators, the labour market is affected by factors that tend to occur at around the same time every year; for example school leavers entering the labour market in July and whether Easter falls in March or April. In order to compare movements other than annual changes in labour market statistics, such as since the previous quarter or since the previous month, the data are seasonally adjusted to remove the effects of seasonal factors and the arrangement of the calendar.\n"

This was the lowest growth rate since 2009 (when negative growth rates were recorded as the financial crisis impacted on bonus payments). The single month growth rate for total pay for May 2014 (0.4%) was unusually low, partly due to a relatively high growth rate of 1.8% the previous May.\n\nBetween May 2013 and May 2014, the Consumer Prices Index increased by 1.5%.\n\n#### Chart 6.1 Average earnings and consumer prices annual growth rates\n\n[![Chart 6.1 Average earnings and consumer prices annual growth rates](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/awechart_tcm77-367334.png)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/awechart_tcm77-367334.png \"Chart 6.1 Average earnings and consumer prices annual growth rates\")\nSource: Office for National Statistics\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1.

The estimates are in current prices; this means that they are not adjusted for price inflation. The estimates relate to Great Britain and include salaries but not unearned income, benefits in kind or arrears of pay.\n2. As well as pay settlements, the estimates reflect bonuses, changes in the number of paid hours worked and the impact of employees paid at different rates joining and leaving individual businesses. The estimates also reflect changes in the overall structure of the workforce; for example, fewer low paid jobs in the economy would have an upward effect on the earnings growth rate.\n3. Lloyds Banking Group plc is reclassified to the private sector from April 2014 following the sale of some government owned shares to private sector investors. It is classified to the public sector between July 2009 and March 2014. ONS estimates that, if the reclassification had not occurred, the public sector single month growth rate from April 2014 would have been around 0.3 percentage points higher and the corresponding private sector growth rate would have been around 0.1 percentage points lower.\n4. From June 2012 onwards English Further Education Corporations and Sixth Form College Corporations are classified to the private sector, but for earlier time periods they are classified to the public sector. This affects the public and private sector single month growth rates from June 2012 to May 2013, and the three month average growth rates from April-June 2012 to May-July 2013. ONS estimates that, if the reclassification had not occurred, the public sector single month growth rates between June 2012 and May 2013 would have been between 0.6 and 0.8 percentage points lower and the corresponding private sector growth rates would have been between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points higher.\n"

The Claimant Count does not yet include people claiming Universal Credit - a new benefit which, for the June 2014 Claimant Count date, had been introduced in only ten Jobcentre Plus offices. The absence of Universal Credit claimants is expected to have a small effect on the Claimant Count from May 2013. See Background Notes to this Statistical Bulletin for further details.\n2. The Claimant Count includes people who claim Jobseeker’s Allowance but who do not receive payment. For example some claimants will have had their benefits stopped for a limited period of time by Jobcentre Plus; this is known as “sanctioning”. Some people claim Jobseeker’s Allowance in order to receive National Insurance Credits.\n"

      "markdown": "[Unemployment](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-guidance/guide-to-labour-market-statistics/guide-to-unemployment.html \"Unemployment\") is measured according to internationally accepted guidelines specified by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Unemployed people in the UK are:\n\n- without a job, have actively sought work in the last four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks, or;\n- out of work, have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks.\n\nPeople who meet these criteria are classified as unemployed irrespective of whether or not they claim Jobseeker’s Allowance or other benefits. The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey and are published for three month average time periods.\n\nThe [Claimant Count](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-guidance/guide-to-labour-market-statistics/guide-to-claimant-count.html \"Claimant Count\") measures the number of people claiming benefits principally for the reason of being unemployed. Since October 1996 it has been a count of the number of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA). Some JSA claimants will not be classified as unemployed. For example, people in employment working fewer than 16 hours a week can be eligible to claim JSA depending on their income.\n\nChart 10.1 and the associated spreadsheet compare quarterly movements in unemployment and the Claimant Count for the same three month average time periods. The unemployment estimates shown in this comparison exclude unemployed people in the 16 to 17 and 65 and over age groups as well as unemployed people aged from 18 to 24 in full-time education. This provides a more meaningful comparison with the Claimant Count than total unemployment because people in these population groups are not usually eligible to claim JSA.\n\nWhen three month average estimates for the Claimant Count are compared with unemployment estimates for the same time periods and for the same population groups (people aged from 18 to 64 excluding 18 to 24 year olds in full-time education), between December 2013 to February 2014 and March to May 2014:\n\n- unemployment fell by 114,000, and\n- the Claimant Count fell by 94,000.\n\n#### Chart 10.1 Quarterly changes in Unemployment and the Claimant Count (aged 18 to 64), seasonally adjusted\n\n[![Chart 10.1 Quarterly changes in Unemployment and the Claimant Count (aged 18 to 64), seasonally adjusted](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/comparisonchart_tcm77-367484.png)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/comparisonchart_tcm77-367484.png \"Chart 10.1 Quarterly changes in Unemployment and the Claimant Count (aged 18 to 64), seasonally adjusted\")\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1.

This was:\n\n- down from 21.9% for December 2013 to February 2014, and\n- down from 22.5% for a year earlier.\n\nThe economic inactivity rate was last at 21.7% in 1990 and, since comparable records began in 1971, it has never been lower.\n\nThere were 8.78 million economically inactive people aged from 16 to 64 for March to May 2014.

Since comparable records began in 1992, the proportion of people aged from 16 to 24 in full-time education has increased substantially from 24.3% for March to May 1992 to 42.3% for March to May 2014. Increasing numbers of young people going into full-time education reduces the size of the economically active population and therefore increases the unemployment rate.\n"

      "title": "Revisions",
      "markdown": "Estimates for the most recent time periods are subject to revision due to the receipt of late and corrected responses to business surveys and revisions to seasonal adjustment factors which are re-estimated every month. Estimates are subject to longer run revisions, on an annual basis, resulting from reviews of the seasonal adjustment process. Estimates derived from the Labour Force Survey (a survey of households) are usually only revised once a year. Revisions to estimates derived from other sources are usually minor and are commented on in the Statistical Bulletin if this is not the case. Further information is available in the [Labour Market Statistics Revisions Policy (36.7 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/revisions/revisions-policies-by-theme/labour-market/labour-market-statistics-revisions-policy.pdf \"Labour Market Statistics Revisions Policy\").\n\nOne indication of the reliability of the key indicators in this Statistical Bulletin can be obtained by monitoring the size of revisions.

These indicators only report summary measures for revisions. The revised data itself may be subject to sampling or other sources of error. The ONS standard presentation is to show five years worth of revisions (60 observations for a monthly series, 20 for a quarterly series).\n"

      "title": "Accuracy of the Statistics: Estimating and Reporting Uncertainty",
      "markdown": "Most of the figures in this Statistical Bulletin come from surveys of households or businesses. Surveys gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population.  The sample is designed carefully to allow for this, and to be as accurate as possible given practical limitations like time and cost constraints, but results from sample surveys are always estimates, not precise figures. This means that they are subject to some uncertainty. This can have an impact on how changes in the estimates should be interpreted, especially for short-term comparisons.\n\nWe can calculate the level of uncertainty (also called “sampling variability”) around a survey estimate by exploring how that estimate would change if we were to draw many survey samples for the same time period instead of just one. This allows us to define a range around the estimate (known as a “confidence interval”) and to state how likely it is in practice that the real value that the survey is trying to measure lies within that range. Confidence intervals are typically set up so that we can be 95% sure that the true value lies within the range – in which case we refer to a “95% confidence interval”.\n\nFor example, the unemployment rate for March to May 2014 was estimated to be 6.5%. This figure had a stated 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.2 percentage points. This means that we can be 95% certain that the true unemployment rate for March to May 2014 was between 6.3% and 6.7%.  However, the best estimate from the survey was that the unemployment rate was 6.5%.\n\nThe number of people unemployed for the same period was estimated at 2,122,000, with a stated 95% confidence interval of +/- 77,000.  This means that we can be 95% sure that the true number of unemployed people was between 2,045,000 and 2,199,000.  Again, the best estimate from the survey was that the number of unemployed people was 2,122,000.\n\nAs well as calculating precision measures around the numbers and rates obtained from the survey, we can also calculate them for changes in the numbers.  For example, for March to May 2014, the estimated change in the number of unemployed people since December 2013 to February 2014 was a fall of 121,000, with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 84,000.  This means that we can be 95% certain the actual change in unemployment was somewhere between a fall of 37,000 and a fall of 205,000, with the best estimate being a fall of 121,000. As the estimated fall in unemployment of 121,000 is greater than the confidence interval of 84,000, the estimated fall in unemployment is said to be “statistically significant”; we can be confident that there has been a fall in unemployment.\n\n### Working with uncertain estimates\n\nIn general, changes in the numbers (and especially the rates) reported in this Statistical Bulletin between three month periods are small, and are not usually greater than the level that is explainable by sampling variability. In practice, this means that small, short-term movements in reported rates (for example within +/- 0.3 percentage points) should be treated as indicative, and considered alongside medium and long-term patterns in the series and corresponding movements in administrative sources, where available, to give a fuller picture.\n\n### Seasonal adjustment and uncertainty\n\nLike many economic indicators, the labour market is affected by factors that tend to occur at around the same time every year; for example school leavers entering the labour market in July and whether Easter falls in March or April. In order to compare movements other than annual changes in labour market statistics, such as since the previous quarter or since the previous month, the data are seasonally adjusted to remove the effects of seasonal factors and the arrangement of the calendar. All estimates discussed in this Statistical Bulletin are seasonally adjusted except where otherwise stated. While seasonal adjustment is essential to allow for robust comparisons through time, it is not possible to estimate uncertainty measures for the seasonally adjusted series.\n\n### Where to find data about uncertainty and reliability\n\n[Data table A11 (48 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-a11.xls \"Data table A11\") shows sampling variabilities for estimates derived from the **Labour Force Survey**.\n\n[Data table JOBS07 (44.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-jobs07.xls \"Data table JOBS07\") shows sampling variabilities for estimates of **workforce jobs**.\n\nThe sampling variability of the three month average **vacancies** level is around +/- 1.5% of that level.\n\nSampling variability information for **Average Weekly Earnings** growth rates are available from the “Sampling Variability” worksheets within [data tables EARN01 (478 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-earn01.xls \"data tables EARN01\") and [EARN03 (586.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-earn03.xls \"EARN03\").\n"

      "markdown": "1. **This month’s release**\nA new data table (Excel spreadsheet) has been introduced providing an indicative representation of the Claimant Count including experimental Universal Credit statistics. See Background Note 4 below for further details.\n\n2. **Next month’s release**\nThere will be revisions to estimates of the proportion of the population (aged from 16 to 64) claiming key out of work benefits for 2013, published at Table 25 of the pdf version of this Statistical Bulletin and at [data table BEN01 (59 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-ben01.xls \"data table BEN01\"). These revisions will result from taking on board the latest population estimates.\n\n3. **Revisions to Labour Force Survey estimates planned for October 2014**\nONS currently plans to revise estimates derived from the Labour Force Survey (including estimates of employment, unemployment and economic inactivity), in the October 2014 edition of this Statistical Bulletin, as a result of taking on board population estimates from the 2011 Census. Estimates will be revised back to June to August 2001. ONS plans to publish an article in late September 2014 which will include details of the back revisions to the headline estimates of employment, unemployment and economic inactivity.\n\n4. **Introduction of Universal Credit**\nThe Pathfinder for Universal Credit started on 29 April 2013 with the introduction of this new benefit in one Jobcentre Plus office (**Ashton under Lyne**). The pathfinder was extended to a second Jobcentre Plus office (**Wigan**) on 1 July 2013 and two further offices (**Oldham** and **Warrington**) joined the pathfinder on 29 July 2013.\n\nThe progressive national roll out of Universal Credit across the rest of the UK commenced with **Hammersmith** Jobcentre Plus office on 28 October 2013 and was followed by:\n\n- **Rugby** and **Inverness** Jobcentre Plus offices on 25 November 2013,\n- **Harrogate** and **Bath** Jobcentre Plus offices on 24 February 2014, and\n- **Shotton** Jobcentre Plus office on 7 April 2014.\n\nBy 12 June 2014 (the Claimant Count date for June 2014), Universal Credit had been introduced in the above mentioned 10 Jobcentre Plus offices. On 20 June 2014, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) published a press release announcing the further expansion of Universal Credit across the North West region.\n\nUniversal Credit will replace a number of means-tested benefits including the means-tested element of Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA). It will not replace contributory based JSA.\n\nThe Claimant Count measures the number of people claiming benefits principally for the reason of being unemployed. Since October 1996 it has been a count of the number of people claiming JSA. Following a consultation in 2012 by ONS, it was decided that, with the introduction of Universal Credit, the Claimant Count would include:\n\n- people claiming contribution-based JSA (which is not affected by the introduction of Universal Credit),\n- people claiming income-based JSA during the transition period while this benefit is being gradually phased out, and\n- people claiming Universal Credit who are not earning and who are subject to a full set of labour market jobseeker requirements, that is required to be actively seeking work and available to start work.\n\n**The Claimant Count estimates from May 2013 onwards, published in this Statistical Bulletin, do not include claimants of Universal Credit**. ONS will include jobseeker Universal Credit claims in the Claimant Count statistics as soon as possible.\n\nIn this release, ONS is publishing a new spreadsheet, [data table CLA03 (66.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-prod01.xls \"data table CLA03\"), providing an indicative adjusted Claimant Count which initially includes experimental estimates of all claimants of Universal Credit (not just those who are jobseekers) as well as all JSA claimants. To maintain continuity of table numbering, the Claimant Count revisions triangle data table has been renumbered from CLA03 to CLA04.\n\nThe absence of Universal Credit claimants is expected to have a small effect on the Claimant Count from May 2013. This assessment reflects the information published at [data table CLA03 (66.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/table-prod01.xls \"data table CLA03\").\n\n5. **Publication policy**\nPublication dates up to the end of 2015 are available in the Background Notes to the [June 2014 edition of this Statistical Bulletin](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/june-2014/statistical-bulletin.html \"June 2014 edition of this Statistical Bulletin\").\n\nA list of the job titles of those given [pre-publication access](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2014/pre-release-list.html \"pre-publication access\") to the contents of this Statistical Bulletin is available on the website.\n\n6.
