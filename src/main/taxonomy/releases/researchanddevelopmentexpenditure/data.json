      "summary": "This release provides estimates of R\u0026D performed in and funded by the following four sectors of the economy, as defined in the ‘Frascati Manual’: Business Enterprise (BERD), Higher Education (HERD), Government (GovERD), which includes Research Councils, and Private Non-Profit (PNP) organisations. All these sectors’ R\u0026D data are known collectively as GERD, which represents the gross domestic expenditure on R\u0026D in the UK. GERD is unique in providing this information, and is the preferred measure of R\u0026D activity for use in international comparisons. This release reports on R\u0026D expenditure in the UK irrespective of the residence of the ultimate owner or users of the R\u0026D produced. The main purpose of collecting R\u0026D data from all sectors of the economy is to supply data for policy and monitoring purposes on science and technology, of which R\u0026D is an important part.",
