The rate of inflation used in the UK governmentï¿½s inflation target is measured using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). One way to understand the CPI is to think of a very large shopping basket containing a large selection of the goods and services bought by households, the CPI estimates changes to the total cost of this basket.",
