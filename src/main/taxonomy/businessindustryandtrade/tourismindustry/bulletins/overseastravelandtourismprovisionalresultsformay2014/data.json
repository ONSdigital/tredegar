  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

Revised, final estimates will be published in Travel Trends - 2014 in 2015.

The title of the monthly Overseas Travel and Tourism bulletin was renamed in December 2013 to \"Overseas Travel and Tourism, Provisional Results for [Month] 2013\" to clarify that the data contained in these bulletins are provisional.\n\n- The sample profile and responses are calibrated to international passenger traffic for the reporting period.\n\n- Estimates are based on interviews conducted when passengers end their visit. Therefore any visits commencing in the reported month but not completed until later are not included in estimates for the reported month.\n\n- Spending associated with visits includes anything spent before, during and after the trip.\n\n- Parts of the bulletin refer to countries visited abroad. It should be noted that if a UK resident visited more than one country on a trip abroad, the country recorded as visited in this publication is the country that was visited for the longest period.\n\n- Estimates are subject to sampling error, and confidence intervals are provided to help readers interpret the estimates (see background note: Accuracy of IPS estimates).

The count of visits relates to UK residents returning to this country and to overseas residents leaving it.\n\n2. **Day-visits** (that is trips that do not involve an overnight stay) abroad by UK residents as well as day trips to the UK by overseas residents are included in the figures for visits and expenditure. Please note they do not cover day visits to or from the Irish Republic across the land border, although they are included in total visits.\n\n3. An **overseas visitor** means a person who, being permanently resident in a country outside the United Kingdom, visits the UK for a period of less than 12 months. UK citizens resident overseas for 12 months or more coming home on leave are included in this category. Visits abroad are visits for a period of less than 12 months by people permanently resident in the UK (who may be of foreign nationality).\n\n4. When a resident of the UK has visited more than one **country the entire visit, expenditure and stay are allocated to the country stayed in for the longest time**.\n\n5. Visits for **miscellaneous** purposes include those for study; to attend sporting events; for shopping; health; religious; or for other purposes; together with visits for more than one purpose when none predominates (for example visits both on business and on holiday). Overseas visitors staying overnight in the UK en route to other destinations are also included in miscellaneous purposes.\n\n6. Adjustments are made to the reported cost of an **inclusive tour** so that only the amount earned by the country of visit (for example accommodation costs, car hire, etc.) is included. This estimate is then added to an individual\u0027s spending to give the total spending in the country of visit (see also note 7).\n\n7. **Earnings and expenditure** figures cover the same categories of travellers as do the number of visits, except that in addition the earnings figures include the expenditure by same day transit passengers , and the foreign exchange earnings and expenditure due to travel relating to the Channel Islands. They exclude payments for air, sea and rail travel to and from the UK. For any traveller on an inclusive tour an estimate of the return fare is deducted from the total tour price.\n\n8. Earnings do not include the personal export of cars that have been purchased in the United Kingdom by overseas residents. Similarly spending excludes the personal import of cars by UK residents.\n\n9. An estimate for purchases by overseas visitors at airport **duty free** shops is included in the figures for earnings. Such purchases on British carriers are still excluded\n"

Miscellaneous: Other reasons or cases where the respondent is not able to give a single purpose as the main reason for visit.\n\n5. People migrating (to or from the UK) or travelling as crew of aircraft, ships or trains are excluded from analysis in this publication\n\n### Background Notes: Sample Methodology\n1. The International Passenger Survey (IPS) produces estimates that are based on interviews with a stratified random sample of passengers entering and leaving the UK on the principle air, tunnel and sea routes. The main features of the stratification are: mode of transport (that is air, tunnel or sea), port and time of day.\n\n2. The frequency of sampling within each stratum depends mainly on the variation of tourist expenditure and on the volume of migrants, for which the survey is also used to collect statistics. To collect Overseas Travel and Tourism information, travellers passing through passport control are randomly selected for interview and in all some 296,000 interviews were conducted in 2013. Only interviews carried out at the end of a visit are used to generate estimates of expenditure and stay. Of these interviews around 49,000 provided the published information on foreign visitors to the UK and around 59,000 were used for the estimate of UK residents travelling abroad. The interviews were conducted on a purely voluntary and anonymous basis.\n\n3. Despite the introduction in April 1999 of interviewing on air and sea routes to and from the Irish Republic the results from the IPS are still supplemented with estimates of travel between UK and the Irish Republic over the land border where no IPS interviewing takes place. Estimates for travel by land are based on information provided by the Central Statistics Office of the Irish Republic. Estimates of earnings and expenditure are also supplemented with figures from the Economic Advisor\u0027s Office of the States of Jersey, who provide information about the Channel Islands.\n\n4. Over 95% of passengers entering and leaving the UK (excluding those travelling by land to and from the Irish Republic) travel on routes covered by the survey. The remainder are either passengers travelling at night when interviewing is suspended, or on those routes too small in volume to be covered. For those passengers, estimates are made and input into the main results of the survey.\n\n5. At the major airports a sample of half days is taken and a fixed proportion of passengers are interviewed, whilst the smaller airports are sampled occasionally with the number of visits depending on the number of international passengers.\n\n6. On the sea routes either particular cross-channel sailings are sampled and a fixed proportion of passengers interviewed on board, or a sample of days is taken and the passengers interviewed on the quay side.\n\n7. In all, approximately 296,000 travellers (0.2% of the total travellers) were interviewed in 2013; this proportion varies from port to port.\n\n8. UK residents who left a cuise boat at a foreign port and returned home on a scheduled air or sea service (e.g. fly-cruises) are included in the IPS. Information on the number of passengers on cruises finishing in the UK is estimated in terms of the number of visits, length of stay and expenditure. These estimates are added to the cruise data collected from the IPS and included under the headings for \u0027other areas\u0027, \u0027holiday\u0027, and \u0027sea\u0027. In 2010 a review took place of the methodology used to estimate the number of such visits. This review has led to more accurate methodology for estimating these visits and has resulted in an annual increase from the approximately 20,000 to 200,000 of such visits. The new estimates have been included since the publication Travel Trends 2010, published in late July 2011.\n\n9. A complex weighting procedure is used in the survey results taking account of passengers  movement statistics produced by the BAA plc and the Civil Aviation Authority for air traffic by the Department for Transport for sea traffic. For Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester allowances are made for passengers in transit who do not pass through passport control and hence do not cross the IPS counting line.\n\n10.

This error affects expenditure estimates for January to September 2014 and has resulted in the UK Statistics Authority suspending the National Statistics designation of the expenditure series within the Overseas Travel and Tourism releases until the figures have been corrected. [http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-andrew-dilnot-to-john-pullinger-141114.pdf](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-andrew-dilnot-to-john-pullinger-141114.pdf)**\n\n**Corrected expenditure estimates for UK residents’ visits abroad and overseas residents’ visits to the UK will be published for all months, January to September 2014, and Quarter 1 and 2, as soon as possible. Please note that the UK Trade time series data are also affected by this error and will be updated with the corrected data when it becomes available. ONS will announce the timetable for the publishing of corrected figures prior to their release. The ONS statement regarding this error can be found here:  [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/media-centre/statements/correction-to-overseas-travel-and-tourism-expenditure-data/index.html](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/media-centre/statements/correction-to-overseas-travel-and-tourism-expenditure-data/index.html)**\n\n\n1. Figures for the most recent months are provisional and subject to revision in light of (a) more accurate data on passenger figures becoming available at the end of each quarter and (b) additional passenger data obtained at the end of each year.\n\nIPS monthly estimates are revised in line with the IPS revisions policy . The revisions policy is available in the [IPS Quality and Methodology Information (331.7 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/travel-and-transport-methodology/international-passenger-survey-methodology/international-passenger-survey-quality-and-methodology-information.pdf \"International Passenger Survey Quality and Methodology Information\") paper to assist users in the understanding of the cycle and frequency of data revisions. Users of this bulletin are strongly advised to read this policy before using this data for research or policy related purposes.\n\nPlanned revisions usually arise from either the receipt of revised passenger traffic data or the correction of errors to existing data identified later in the quarterly and annual processing cycle. Those of significant magnitude will be highlighted and explained.\n\nRevisions to published monthly IPS estimates can be expected at the following times in the normal Overseas Travel and Tourism publication schedule:\n\n- Monthly estimates for the current reference year will usually be revised and statisically benchmarked accross the quarter following the publication of the quarterly estimates within which that month falls\n- Monthly and quarterly estimates for the current reference year will be revised in the survey year’s annual data release (Travel Trends)\n- Monthly estimates, for the full calendar year, will be statistically benchmarked as part of the annual data processing and the monthly estimates for the year will then be replaced in the monthly release with the benchmarked estimate following publication of the annual report (Travel Trends)\n\nAll other revisions will be regarded as unplanned and will be dealt with by non-standard releases. All revisions will be released in compliance with the same principles as other new information. Please refer to the [ONS guide to statistical revisions](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/revisions/guide-to-statistical-revisions/index.html \"ONS guide to statistical revisions\").\n\n2. The main series are seasonally adjusted. This aids interpretation by identifying seasonal patterns and calendar effects and removing them from the unadjusted data. The resulting figures give a more accurate indication of underlying movements in the series.\n\n3. The estimates produced from the IPS are subject to sampling errors that result because not every traveller to and from the UK is interviewed on the survey. Sampling errors are determined both by the sample design and by the sample size - generally speaking, the larger the sample supporting a particular estimate, the proportionately lower its sampling error. The survey sample size is approximately 25,000 per month. However, as the intensity of the sampling varies at each port, figures of a similar magnitude will not necessarily have the same percentage sampling error.\n\nThe IPS has a clustered sample design. The full effects of this complex sample design upon each of the main estimates is calculated, and it is calculated the \u0027complex\u0027 sampling errors which are quoted.\n\nAccuracy of the estimates is expressed in terms of confidence intervals. The confidence interval is a range within which the true value of a proportion lies with known probability. For example, the 95% confidence interval represents the range into which there are 19 chances out of 20 that the true figure would fall had all passengers been sampled. This is obtained as +/- 1.96 the standard error.\n\n#### Table 3: Confidence Intervals relating to Overseas Travel and Tourism estimates in May 2014\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table: \n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ott/overseas-travel-and-tourism---monthly-release/may-2014/prt-confidence-intervals--may-2014.xls \"XLS format\") (31 Kb)\n\n#### Table 4: Sampling Errors, Q1 2014\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table: \n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ott/overseas-travel-and-tourism---quarterly-release/q1-2014/prt-confidence-intervals--q1-2014.xls \"XLS format\") (36 Kb)\n\n#### Table A: IPS confidence intervals for 2013 estimates\n\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table: \n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ott/travel-trends/2013/prt---table-a--ips-confidence-intervals-for-2013-estimates.xls \"XLS format\") (31.5 Kb)\n\nEstimates are provided in the relevant Overseas Travel and Tourism publications published by ONS.\nOne indication of the reliability of the key indicators in this release can be obtained by monitoring the size of revisions.

The changes involve revision to sample design, weighting and imputation methodology. These changes resulted in some discontinuity in estimates. An analysis was conducted and published in 2009. More details are available from the IPS team.\n\n2. The model used to produce seasonal adjustment estimates is reviewed approximately every two years. A review was conducted in late 2009 and the new model was used for the first time to produce the seasonally adjusted estimates used in the December 2009 \u0027Statistical Bulletin\u0027 publication.

      "markdown": "Statistical series are affected by special events. However, as explained in ONS\u0027s special events policy, it is not possible to make an estimate of the effect of particular events only on the basis of information collected in those series. However, ONS publishes a [special events calendar](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/special-events-group/special-events-calendar/index.html \"special events calendar\") which may help the reader put some context on reported estimates.\n\nThere were a number of special events in 2012. The Diamond Jubilee celebrations saw changes to the normal pattern of Bank holidays in May and June, and an additional day\u0027s holiday in June; all of these changes affected estimates for quarter 2 of 2012, and an [article](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q2-2012.html \"Gross Domestic Product: Preliminary Estimate - Q2 2012 \") gave more information on how estimates were compiled over this period. The Olympics took place from 27 July to 12 August 2012 (with a few events starting on 25 July), and Paralympics from 29 August to 9 September. The direct effect of the Olympics and Paralympics were reflected in the estimates for the months of quarter 3 of 2012. More details of how certain series were expected to be affected were given in an [Information Note](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/special-events-group/special-events-calendar/olympics-information-note/index.html \"Olympics Information Note\").

Wider effects, for example the presence of the Olympics influencing the number of non-Olympic tourist visits, may of course have affected any of the summer months.\n\nThe result of these special events in 2012 has been to introduce additional uncertainty in the interpretation of movements between Q2 and Q3 and between Q3 and Q4. Users should therefore consider all information available when interpreting the statistics.\n"
