  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

      "markdown": "- The resident population of England and Wales on 27 March 2011 was 56.1 million, a seven per cent (3.7 million) increase since 2001 with\n- 55 per cent (2.1 million) of this increase being due to migration. One in six people were aged 65 or over (16 per cent, 9.2 million).\n- In 2011, four out of every five (81 per cent, 45.5 million) residents of England and Wales described themselves as being in good or very good health.\n- Ten per cent (5.8 million) of residents of England and Wales provided unpaid care for someone with an illness or disability. This was the same percentage as in 2001 (10 per cent, 5.2 million). Over a third (37 per cent, 2.1 million) of these people were giving 20 or more hours care a week, an increase of five percentage points (473,000) on 2001 (32 per cent, 1.7 million).\n- The number of residents who stated that their religion was Christian in 2011 was fewer than in 2001. The size of this group decreased 13 percentage points to 59 per cent (33.2 million) in 2011 from 72 per cent (37.3 million) in 2001. The size of the group who stated that they had no religious affiliation increased by 10 percentage points from 15 per cent (7.7 million) in 2001 to 25 per cent (14.1 million) in 2011.\n- Most residents of England and Wales belonged to the White ethnic group (86 per cent, 48.2 million) in 2011, and the majority of these belonged to the White British group (80 per cent of the total population, 45.1 million). In London in 2011, 45 per cent (3.7 million) out of 8.2 million usual residents were White British.\n- Twelve per cent (2.0 million) of households with at least two people had partners or household members of different ethnic groups in 2011, a three percentage point increase on 2001 (nine per cent, 1.4 million).\n- Of the 13 per cent (7.5 million) of residents of England and Wales on 27 March 2011 who were born outside of the UK, just over half (3.8 million) arrived in the last 10 years.\n- Nearly 4.8 million residents held a non-UK passport that was either an EU passport (2.3 million) or a foreign passport (2.4 million).\n- Sixty four per cent (14.9 million) of households owned their own home in 2011, either with a mortgage or loan, or outright. Home ownership decreased four percentage points since 2001, but more people owned their home outright, an increase of two percentage points from 29 per cent (6.4 million) to 31 per cent (7.2 million). The group that rented from a private landlord or letting agency increased by six percentage points from nine per cent (1.9 million) in 2001 to 15 per cent (3.6 million) in 2011.\n- The number of cars and vans available for use by households in England and Wales increased from 23.9 million to 27.3 million between 2001 and 2011. In 2001 there were on average 11 cars per 10 households whereas in 2011 there were 12 cars per 10 households. The proportion of households with access to no cars or one car declined over the decade whereas the proportion with two or more cars rose. London was the only region where the number of cars and vans was lower than the number of households.\n- In 2011 there were more people with Level 4 or above qualifications, eg Bachelor’s degree (27 per cent, 12.4 million), than people with no qualifications (23 per cent, 10.3 million).\n"

      "markdown": "This bulletin describes the population of England and Wales based on information collected in the 2011 Census. It captures the defining characteristics of the population, who we are, how we live and what we do. This bulletin is grouped into these three sections.\n\nThe census is unique because it is the only information source that measures these characteristics together across the whole population. The outputs are published at national, regional and local authority level and this bulletin provides commentary at national and regional level.\n\nDuring 2013 ONS will provide this information at geographical levels smaller than the local authority, and then in cross tabulations between characteristics, such as by age or ethnicity. This will provide an even richer and more valuable data source for the many users of the census.\n\n### About the census\n\nThe census has collected information about the population every 10 years since 1801 (except in 1941). The latest census in England and Wales took place on 27 March 2011.\n\nCensus estimates describe the characteristics of areas down to small geographies, and are used to understand similarities and differences in the population’s characteristics locally, regionally and nationally. This information is used for planning and delivering services, for example information about ethnicity is used for equality monitoring, and vehicle ownership is used for transportation and road planning. The census is the only comprehensive source of small area data about the provision of unpaid care and it is used to support policy makers in decision making. Previous releases of census estimates have provided more information about their uses; [release on 16 July 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-england-and-wales/index.html \"Population and Household Estimates for England and Wales\").\n\nFurther information about the census estimates, including details about the methodology used and information about how population subgroups are defined and estimated, is available via the [2011 Census home page](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html \"[2011 Census\").\n\nPersonal census information is not shared with any other government department or national, regional or local bodies. The information collected is kept confidential by ONS, and is protected by law. Individual census records are not released for 100 years.\n\n### About this release\n\nEstimates from the 2011 Census for England and Wales are being released in stages as soon as ONS can make them available. More information on the planned releases can be found in the [2011 Census prospectus](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-prospectus/index.html \"2011 Census prospectus\"). This bulletin presents key findings from all Key Statistics tables and nine Quick Statistics tables for regions in England and for Wales. UK statistics will be compiled and published after the relevant data becomes available for all four countries: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis bulletin is about the usually resident population and households. It does not refer to visitors or short-term residents. A usual resident is anyone who, on census day, was in the UK and had stayed or intended to stay in the UK for a period of 12 months or more, or had a permanent UK address and was outside the UK and intended to be outside the UK for less than 12 months.\n\nSome estimates from the 2011 Census have already been published. For example the [release on 16 July 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-england-and-wales/index.html \"Population and Household Estimates for England and Wales\") provided estimates of the usually resident population by age and sex, population by residence type, household estimates and estimates of numbers of short-term residents. Information on the number of residents with a [second address](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/second-address-estimates-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/index.html \"Second address estimates for local authorities in England and Wales\") has also been released.\n\nIn making comparisons to 2001, the population estimates (by age and sex) have been compared with the mid-year estimates for 2001, 52.4 million for England and Wales. For other characteristics, comparisons are made with 2001 Census estimates, 52.0 million for England and Wales. Footnotes are provided with tables to identify the data sources used.\n\nMore detailed analyses of the census estimates are available for some topics via ONS “short stories”. Four of these are published in parallel with this bulletin on the ONS website. Three present analyses of international migration, ethnicity and national identity, and religion. The fourth is a report on how the census labour market statistics differ from those estimated from the [Labour Force Survey](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/ons---search-definition-results/labour-force-survey.html \"Labour Force Survey\") at the national, regional and local and unitary authority level.\n\nKey and Quick Statistics tables for lower levels of the output area (OA) statistical geography hierarchy and for the ward geography hierarchy will be published on 30 January 2013. Further short stories will be published alongside this release and subsequently, covering families, general health and disability, unpaid care, language, occupation and industry, qualifications and economic activity."

It covers our general health, whether we had an illness or disability that limited our day to day activities, our religious beliefs, our ethnicity, our national identity, whether or not we were born in the UK and when we arrived, what passports we held and our language skills.\n\nThe resident population of England and Wales on 27 March 2011 was 56.1 million, a seven per cent (3.7 million) increase since 2001 with 55 per cent (2.1 million) of this increase being due to migration. One in six people were aged 65 or over (16 per cent, 9.2 million).\n\nFour out of every five usual residents of England and Wales described themselves as in very good or good health (81 per cent, 45.5 million).\n\nFifty nine per cent (33.2 million) recorded their religion as Christian and 25 per cent (14.1 million) reported that they had no religious affiliation.\n\nMost residents of England and Wales belonged to the White ethnic group (86 per cent, 48.2 million) in 2011, and the majority of these belonged to the White British group (80 per cent of the total population, 45.1 million). In London in 2011, 45 per cent (3.7 million) out of 8.2 million usual residents were White British.\n\nNinety one per cent (51.0 million) usual residents considered themselves to have at least one national identity of English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, or British.\n"

These showed that on 27 March 2011, the population of England and Wales was 56.1 million usual residents; 53.0 million in England and 3.1 million in Wales. There were 27.6 million men and 28.5 million women in the two countries.\n\nThe population grew by seven per cent (3.7 million) since 2001, and migration accounted for 55 per cent (2.1 million) of the population increase in England and Wales in the 10 year period, both from within the UK and from abroad.\n\nOne in six (16 per cent, 9.2 million), of the population was aged 65 and over. This was an increase of 0.9 million on 2001 (but the same percentage of the usually resident population as in 2001). The population aged over 90 years rose from 0.7 per cent (336,000) in 2001 to 0.8 per cent (429,000). Similarly, six per cent (3.5 million) of the usually resident population in England and Wales were children under five, an increase of 406,000, and the same percentage of the population as in 2001.\n\nThere were 23.4 million households in England and Wales, with an average of 2.4 residents per household. All regions of England, and Wales, saw population growth between 2001 and 2011, with the highest growth in London, the East of England and East Midlands.\n\n[Information published so far from 2011 Census](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-england-and-wales/index.html \"Population and Household Estimates in England and Wales\") is available on the ONS website.\n"

      "markdown": "### General Health\n\nUsual residents were asked to assess their general state of health on a five point scale: very good, good, fair, bad or very bad. The majority, 81 per cent (45.5 million), described themselves as being in good or very good health, as shown in Figure 1. A further 13 per cent (7.4 million) described their health as fair, and the remaining six per cent (3.1 million) described their health as bad or very bad.\n\nThis was not a new question in 2011 but its structure has changed. In 2001 it was based on a three point scale: good, fairly good or not good. The findings are therefore not directly comparable. For example, some people recording their health as ‘fair’ in 2011 might have said ‘fairly good’ using a 2001 scale but some might have said ‘not good’. An analysis of estimates relating to health and care will be published on 30 January 2013.

The North East had the lowest figures; 44 per cent (1.1 million).\n\nWales and the North East of England had the highest percentages of usual residents reporting bad or very bad health; eight per cent (234,000) and seven per cent (193,000) respectively. The South East had the smallest percentage of residents reporting to be in either bad or very bad health, four per cent (375,000).\n\nInformation on health is provided in table [KS301EW (403.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks301ew.xls \"RFT Table KS301EW\") .\n\n### Long-term activity-limiting illness\n\nIn 2011, those reporting a long term health problem or disability (including those related to age) that limited their day-to-day activities and that had lasted, or was expected to last, at least 12 months, were asked to assess whether their daily activities were limited a lot, a little or not at all by such a health problem. The 2011 estimates are in Table 1.\n\nIn 2001 the long term activity limiting illness response categories were yes and no. To compare 2001 and 2011, the 2011 results for \u0027Yes, limited a lot\u0027 and \u0027Yes, limited a little\u0027 must be amalgamated into a single \u0027Yes\u0027 response. On this basis, the percentage of people in England and Wales with a long-term activity-limiting illness has changed little - 18 per cent (10.0 million) in 2011, compared to 18 per cent (9.5 million) in 2001.\n\nWales had a higher percentage of residents with a long-term illness, 23 per cent (696,000), than any England region. This was also true in 2001 when 23 per cent (676,000) of usual residents had a long-term activity-limiting illness. The North East reported 22 per cent (562,000) of residents with a long-term illness.\n\nLondon had the largest increase in the percentage of residents without a long-term activity-limiting illness, going from 85 per cent (6.1 million) in 2001 to 86 per cent (7.0 million) in 2011 and showing an opposite trend to other regions ie the East and West Midlands, the East of England and the South East and South West.\n\nInformation on long term activity limiting health problems is provided in table [KS301EW (403.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks301ew.xls \"RFT Table KS301EW\").\n"

      "markdown": "The question on religious affiliation in the census was introduced in 2001 and is voluntary. The order of the main religion groups by size did not change between 2001 and 2011. Those affiliated with the Christian religion remained the largest group; 59 per cent (33.2 million) of usual residents in England and Wales.\n\nThis is a decrease of 13 percentage points since 2001 when 72 per cent (37.3 million) of usual residents stated their religion as Christian. It is the only group to have experienced a decrease in numbers between 2001 and 2011 despite population growth.\n\nThe second largest response category in 2011 was no religion. This increased 10 percentage points from 15 per cent (7.7 million) of usual residents in 2001, to 25 per cent (14.1 million) in 2011.\n\nThe next most stated religion in England and Wales was Muslim with five per cent (2.7 million) of usual residents stating their religion as Muslim in the 2011 Census; an increase of two percentage points since 2001 when three per cent (1.5 million) of usual residents stated that they were Muslim.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2011 the percentage of residents affiliating themselves with the Christian religion declined in all England regions and Wales.\n\nThe highest percentage, 68 per cent (1.8 million) of people who responded that their religion was Christian was in the North East. This represents a 12 percentage point decrease on 2001, when this region also had the highest percentage of people who stated that their religion was Christian. London had the lowest percentage of usual residents stating their religion as Christian in both 2011 (48 per cent, 4.0 million) and 2001 (58 per cent, 4.2 million).\n\nLondon had the highest percentage of all other religious affiliations except Sikh; Muslim (12 per cent, 1.0 million), Hindu (five per cent, 411,000), Jewish (two per cent, 149,000), Buddhist (one per cent, 82,000), and other religion (less than one per cent, 48,000). The West Midlands had the highest percentage of people who responded that their religion was Sikh (two per cent, 30,000).\n\nLondon also had the highest percentage of usual residents who did not state a religion in 2011 – eight per cent (693,000) did not answer.\n\nFigure 2 shows that the percentage of residents reporting no religion has increased since 2001 for all England regions and Wales. In Wales, nearly a third (32 per cent, 983,000) of residents stated they had no religion, higher than the England regions and a 14 percentage point increase on 2001.\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity2.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nInformation on religion is provided in tables [KS209EW (269.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks209ew.xls \"RFT Table KS209EW\") and [QS210EW (628.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-qs210ew.xls \"RFT Table QS210EW\") .\n\nFurther discussion of estimates relating to the religions of usual residents in England and Wales is available via a [short story](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-religion.html \"short story\") published as part of this release.\n"

In later releases of census statistics, when cross tabulations become available, it will be possible to see more information about the relationship between national identity and other topics, for example ethnicity and country of birth.\n\nIndividuals could identify themselves on the census questionnaire as having more than one national identity; for example a person could record that they had both English and British national identity. In England and Wales, most usual residents (91 per cent, 51.0 million) reported at least one national identity of English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, or British.\n\nInformation on national identity is provided in table [KS202EW (553.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks202ew.xls \"RFT Table KS202EW) .\n"

This is an increase of four percentage points since 2001 (nine per cent, 4.6 million).\n\nAt the regional level, Figure 6 shows that the percentage of the usually resident population of all England regions and Wales that was foreign born rose between 2001 and 2011, and that the relative distributions across the regions remained the same. In both 2001 and 2011 London had the largest percentage of foreign born residents; increasing 10 percentage points from 27 per cent (1.9 million) of usual residents being foreign born in 2001 to 37 per cent (3.0 million) in 2011. Hence in London in 2011, more than one in three usual residents was non-UK born, whereas in the North East, where the smallest percentage (five per cent, 129,000) of the population was foreign born, the ratio was one in 20.\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity6.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Age and year of arrival\n\nThe 2011 Census was the first to ask for information on the age and year of most recent1 arrival of foreign born usual residents. Sixty eight per cent (5.1 million) of foreign born usual residents were between the ages of 15 and 44 when they arrived, and 27 per cent (2.0 million) arrived when they were aged 14 or younger.\n\nOf the 13 per cent (7.5 million) of residents in England and Wales in 2011 who were not born in the UK, just over half (3.8 million) arrived between 2001 and 2011, as can be seen in Figure 7. This relates to higher levels of migration seen over the last decade due in part due to the accession of 10 countries into the EU in 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, 15 per cent (1.2 million) of non UK born usual residents arrived in England and Wales, and 16 per cent (1.2 million) arrived between 2007 and 2009.

There was little variation across England and Wales, with London reporting the lowest average, 2.5 bedrooms per household, all other England regions with an average of either 2.7 or 2.8, and Wales with an average of 2.9.\n\nThe occupancy ratings of rooms and bedrooms are indicators of deprivation and overcrowding in a household. An occupancy rating of -1 implies that there is one room too few for the number of people living in the household.

In 2011 almost four times as many women (33 per cent, 4.4 million) were part-time employees compared to men (eight per cent, 1.2 million).\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity15.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nInformation on economic activity is provided in tables [KS601EW (360.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks603ew.xls \"RFT Table KS601EW\") , [KS602EW (361 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks602ew.xls \"RFT Table KS602EW\") and [KS603EW (358.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks603ew.xls \"RFT Table KS603EW\") .\n\n### Hours worked\n\nThe number of hours worked1 by employed usual residents aged 16 to 74 decreased overall between 2001 and 2011. In 2001, 16 per cent (3.8 million) of this group worked 49 hours or more. This decreased by three percentage points to 13 per cent in 2011. Similarly; in 2001, 59 per cent (14.0 million) of this population worked 31 to 48 hours; this decreased by one percentage point to 58 per cent (15.3 million) in 2011.\n\nFigure 16 shows the clear difference between males and females in the numbers of hours worked.\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity16.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nInformation on hours worked is provided in table KS604EW (382.5 Kb Excel sheet) .\n\n### Unemployment\n\nAccording to 2011 Census, six per cent (1.8 million) of the economically active population in England and Wales aged between 16 and 74 was unemployed1. This group includes those who had never worked (less than one per cent, 291,000), and those who reported long-term unemployment (one per cent, 706,924).\n\nEconomic activity as collected by 2011 Census is not directly comparable with 2001 due to factors that include changes in the underlying classification and improvements in the questions on the census questionnaire. ONS will publish analysis in 2013 to help users to understand how these estimates have changed in the 10 year period.\n\nThe level of unemployment varied between the regions from eight per cent (103,000) in the North East to five per cent (126,000) in the South West, as can be seen in Figure 17.\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity17.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nInformation on unemployment as collected by the census is provided in tables [KS601EW (360.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks601ew.xls \"RFT Table KS601EW\") , [KS602EW (361 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks602ew.xls \"RFT Table KS602EW\") and [KS603EW (358.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks603ew.xls \"RFT Table KS603EW\") .\n\n#####Notes for Economic activity\n1. Due to definitional differences, and because the census questionnaire is self completed by the population of England and Wales, the census estimates of people in employment may differ from other sources as, for example, some respondents may include voluntary work when asked about employment. The most authoritative and up to date estimates of the labour market status, including employment and  unemployment, are the labour market statistics that ONS publishes monthly. The census is valuable in providing a detailed picture at the time of the census of the characteristics of the economically active population.\n2. Full-time students and the self-employed may also be part-time workers.\n"

Although not a new question in 2011, some of the qualifications estimates are not directly comparable with 2001. This is due to multiple factors including changes in the level assigned to some qualifications, and the addition of a foreign qualification tick-box. Briefly the level categorisation is as follows:\n\n- No qualifications: No formal qualifications.\n- Level 1: 1-4 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications.\n- Level 2: 5 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications.\n- Apprenticeships.\n- Level 3: 2 or more A-levels or equivalent qualifications.\n- Level 4 or above: Bachelors degree or equivalent, and higher qualifications.\n- Other qualifications including foreign qualifications.\n\nIn England and Wales 27 per cent (12.4 million) of usual residents aged 16 and over had achieved Level 4 or above qualifications in 2011. As shown in Figure 18, this was a higher percentage than those that had no qualifications; 23 per cent (10.3 million). The group who reported no qualifications includes those aged 16 and over who were still studying ie some respondents had not completed their education.\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity18.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nOf the England regions and Wales, London reported the highest levels of qualifications held; 38 per cent (2.5 million) of usual residents had Level 4 or above qualifications and 18 per cent (1.2 million) of usual residents had no qualifications.\n\nExcluding London, the highest percentage of Level 4 or above attainment was 30 per cent (2.1 million) in the South East, with the lowest percentage of Level 4 or above attainment in the North East at 22 per cent (473,000), a difference of eight percentage points. When London is included, this range doubles to a difference of 16 percentage points, seen between London and the North East. The percentage of the usually resident population in London and surrounding regions with Level 4 or above qualifications may be related to increased levels of graduate employment opportunities in these areas.\n\n\u003cclass\u003d\"chart-container\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe div frameBorder \u003d\"0\" scrolling \u003d \"no\" src\u003d\"http://onsdigital.github.io/Alpha/bulletins/ethnicity19.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nInformation on qualifications is provided in table [KS501EW (307 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks501ew.xls \"RFT Table KS501EW\").\n"

The census provides estimates of the characteristics of all people and households in England and Wales on census night. These are produced for a variety of users including government, local and unitary authorities, business and communities. The census provides population statistics from a national to local level. This short story discusses the results for England \u0026 Wales.\n\n2. In making comparisons to 2001, the population estimates (by age and sex) have been compared with the mid-year estimates for 2001, 52.4 million. For other characteristics, comparisons are made with 2001 Census estimates, 52.0 million. Footnotes are provided with tables to identify the data sources used.\n\n3. 2001 Census data are available via the [Neighbourhood Statistics](http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Download1.do \"Neighbourhood Statistics\") website.

A person\u0027s place of usual residence is in most cases the address at which they stay the majority of the time. For many people this will be their permanent or family home. If a member of the services did not have a permanent or family address at which they are usually resident, they were recorded as usually resident at their base address.\n\n14. A household is defined as one person living alone, or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\n\n15.
