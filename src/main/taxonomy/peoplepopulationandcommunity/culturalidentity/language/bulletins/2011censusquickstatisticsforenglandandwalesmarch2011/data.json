  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

      "markdown": "This statistical release follows that of the [Key Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/index.html \"Key Statistics for local authorities for England and Wales\") on 11 December 2012 and contains more detailed geographical breakdowns of those tables. It also contains new detailed tables for some characteristics of the people living in England and Wales on 27 March 2011; for example on main language, method of travel to work and economic activity of students as self-reported in the Census. The census is unique because it is the only information source that measures these characteristics across the whole population.\n\nThis bulletin describes new census results at the national and regional geographical level. The supporting census estimates are available to the lowest level of census geography, the output area (OA) statistical geography hierarchy, and also for wards. Later in 2013 cross tabulations of characteristics, such as by age, sex, or ethnicity will be published. This will provide an even richer and more valuable data source for the many users of the census helping us to understand who we are, how we live and what we do.\n\n### About the census\n\nThe census has collected information about the population every 10 years since 1801 (except in 1941). The latest census in England and Wales took place on 27 March 2011.\n\nCensus estimates describe the characteristics of areas down to small geographies, and are used to understand similarities and differences in the populationâ€™s characteristics locally, regionally and nationally. This information is used for planning and delivering services, for example information about ethnicity is used for equality monitoring, and method of travel to work is used for transportation and road planning. The census is the only comprehensive source of small area data on topics such as proficiency in English and main language. It is used to support policy makers in decision-making.\n\nFurther information about the census estimates, including details about the methodology used and information about how population subgroups are defined and estimated is available via the [2011 Census home page](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html \"2011 Census\").\n\nPersonal census information is not shared with any other government department or national, regional or local bodies. The information collected is kept confidential by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and is protected by law. Individual census records are not released for 100 years.\n\n### About this release\n\nStatistics from the 2011 Census for England and Wales are being released in stages. More information on the planned releases can be found in the [2011 Census prospectus](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-prospectus/index.html \"2011 Census prospectus\"). This bulletin presents key findings for regions in England and for Wales from the [Quick Statistics tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition\u003dtcm%3A77-286348 \"Quick Statistics tables\") published on 30 January 2013. UK statistics will be compiled and published once the relevant data becomes available for all four countries: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis bulletin is about the usually resident population and households. It does not refer to visitors or short-term residents. A usual resident is anyone who, on census day, 27 March 2011, was in the UK and had stayed or intended to stay in the UK for a period of 12 months or more, or had a permanent UK address and was outside the UK and intended to be outside the UK for less than 12 months.\n\nSome [estimates from the 2011 Census have already been published](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/index.html \"estimates from the 2011 Census have already been published\"). The first release included estimates of the usually resident population by age and sex, population by residence type, household estimates and estimates of numbers of short-term residents. This was followed by information on the number of usual residents in England and Wales who reported having a second address outside the local authority in which they were usually resident. In December 2012 information from the Key Statistics tables on topics such as health, ethnic group, level of qualification, country of birth, religion, economic activity, and tenure was published to the local authority level of geography.\n\nIn making comparisons with 2001, the census population estimates (by age and sex) have been compared to the mid-year estimates for 2001, 52.4 million for England and Wales. For other characteristics, comparisons are made with 2001 Census results, 52.0 million for England and Wales. Footnotes are provided with tables and charts to identify the data sources used.\n\nMore detailed analyses of the census estimates are available for some topics. Three of these are published in parallel with this bulletin on the ONS website. They present analyses of [families](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-families-short-story.html \"RPT Families Short Story\"), [general health](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rpt-general-health-short-story.html \"RPT General Health Story\") and [disability](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rpt-disability-short-story.html \"RPT Disability Short Story\"). Analysis of ethnicity, international migrants and religion were published alongside the 11 December 2012 release. Further analyses will be published during 2013.\n\nInteractive [data visualisations](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html \"2011 Census Interactive\") developed by ONS are also available to aid interpretation of the results.

Outside of London the percentage of usual residents reporting a main language other than English ranged from three per cent (71,000) in the North East to seven per cent (386,000) in the West Midlands.\n\n- The Key Statistics release of 11th December 2012 included information on household language. In 2011, all usual residents in 91 per cent (21.3 million) of households spoke English as a main language. In a further four per cent (868,000) of households at least one adult spoke English as a main language and in one per cent (182,000) of households no adults but at least one child spoke English as a main language. In the remaining four per cent (1.0 million) of households there were no residents who had English as a main language3.\n\n### Notes for Who we are\n\n1.

This is a two percentage point increase from 2001, when five per cent (2.6 million) of the usually resident population reported that they were 16 to 74 year old full-time students.\n\nStudents are considered resident where they lived during term-time. In all regions, except London, between five and seven per cent of usual residents were 16 to 74 year old full-time students. In London, nine per cent (700,000) of usual residents were 16 to 74 year old full-time students.\n\nStudents can be either economically active (employed or unemployed) or economically inactive (not looking for work)1. In 2011, 29 per cent (1.1 million) of 16 to 74 year old full-time students reported that they were employed; nine per cent (334,000) reported that they were unemployed, and 62 per cent (2.3 million) were economically inactive2.\n\nThe percentage of 16 to 74 year old full-time students in employment in England and Wales ranged from 26 per cent (182,000) in London to 33 per cent (100,000) in the South West.  The South West had the lowest percentage of 16 to 74 year old full-time students who were unemployed (eight per cent, 24,000); the highest percentage was in the North West (ten per cent, 45,000).\n\nThe percentage of 16 to 74 year old full-time students in England and Wales who were economically inactive in 2011 ranged from 59 per cent (182,000) in the South West to 65 per cent (452,000) in London.\n\nInformation on the economic activity of full-time students is provided in table [QS603EW (236.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs603ew.xls \"RFT QS603EW\") .\n\n##### Notes for Students\n1. Due to definitional differences, and because the census questionnaire is self completed by the population of England and Wales, the census estimates of people in employment may differ from other sources as, for example, some respondents may include voluntary work when asked about employment. The most authoritative and up to date estimates of the labour market status, including employment and unemployment, are the labour market statistics that ONS publishes monthly. The census is valuable in providing a detailed picture at the time of the census of the characteristics of the economically active population.\n2. Economic activity as collected by the 2011 Census is not directly comparable with 2001 due to factors that include changes in the underlying classification and improvements in the questions in the Census questionnaire. ONS will publish analysis later in 2013 to help users to understand how these estimates compare with those in the Labour Force Survey.\n"

In other areas the percentage using foot or bicycle varied from 12 per cent (302,000) in the West Midlands to 14 per cent (348,000) in Yorkshire and the Humber.\n\nInformation on travel to work is provided in table [QS701EW (301 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs701ew.xls \"RFT QS701EW\") . A more detailed analysis of this data will be published later in 2013.\n\n##### Notes for Method of travel to work\n1. Due to definitional differences, and because the census questionnaire is self completed by the population of England and Wales, the census estimates of people travelling to work may differ from other sources. In addition, direct comparisons are not possible for mode of travel to work between 2001 and 2011. In 2001, people who recorded their place of work as working mainly at or from home were considered to have their mode of travel to work as working mainly at or from home. In 2011, people working mainly at or from home could record, for example, that they travelled to work as a driver in a car or van, despite being based at home. This extra information is useful for transport planning.\n2.

This publication follows [previous releases of census data](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/index.html \"previous releases of census data\") including household and population totals and local authority level Key Statistics tables. The census provides estimates of the characteristics of all people and households in England and Wales on census day. These are produced for a variety of users including government, local and unitary authorities, business and communities. The census provides population statistics from a national to local level. This bulletin discusses the results at the national and regional level for England and Wales.\n\n2. In making comparisons to 2001, the population estimates (by age and sex) have been compared with the mid-year estimates for 2001, 52.4 million. For other characteristics, comparisons are made with 2001 Census estimates, 52.0 million. Footnotes are provided with tables to identify the data sources used.\n\n3. Both 2001 and 2011 Census data are available via the [Neighbourhood Statistics website](http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/ \"Neighbourhood Statistics website\"). Relevant table numbers are provided in all download files within this publication.\n\n4. Interactive [data visualisations](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html \"2011 Census Interactive\") developed by ONS are also available to aid interpretation of the results.\n\n5. Future releases from the 2011 Census will include more detail in cross tabulations, and tabulations at other geographies. These include wards, health areas, parliamentary constituencies, postcode sectors and national parks. Further information on future releases is available online in the [2011 Census Prospectus](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-prospectus/index.html \"2011 Census Prospectus\").\n\n6.

ONS has ensured that the data collected meet users\u0027 needs via an extensive [2011 Census outputs consultation](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/consultations--users-and-local-partners/index.html \"Consultations, users and local partners\") process in order to ensure that the 2011 Census outputs will be of increased use in the planning of housing, education, health and transport services in future years.\n\n9. Any reference to local authorities includes both local and unitary authorities.\n\n10. Figures in this publication may not sum due to rounding. Percentage point changes in the text are based on rounded data.\n\n11. The England and Wales census questionnaires asked the same questions with one exception; an additional question on Welsh language was included on the Wales questionnaire.\n\n12. ONS is responsible for carrying out the census in England and Wales. Simultaneous but separate censuses took place in Scotland and Northern Ireland. These were run by the National Records of Scotland (NRS) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) respectively.\n\n13. ONS is responsible for the publication of UK statistics (compiling comparable statistics from the UK statistical agencies above). These will be compiled as each of the three statistical agencies involved publish the relevant data. The [Northern Ireland census prospectus](http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/2011CensusProposedOutputs.html \"Northern Ireland census prospectus\") and the [Scotland census prospectus](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/census/censushm2011/index.html \"Scotland census prospectus\") are available online. The [first release of UK population estimates](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-the-united-kingdom/index.html \"Population and Household Estimates for the United Kingdom\") took place on 17 December 2012.\n\n14. A person\u0027s place of usual residence is in most cases the address at which they stay the majority of the time. For many people this will be their permanent or family home. If a member of the services did not have a permanent or family address at which they are usually resident, they were recorded as usually resident at their base address.\n\n15. A household is defined as one person living alone, or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\n\n16. All key terms used in this publication, such as resident and short-term residents are explained in the [2011 Census user guide](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-user-guide/index.html \"2011 Census user guide\").\n\n17. All census population estimates were extensively quality assured, using other national and local sources of information for comparison and review by a series of quality assurance panels. An extensive range of [quality assurance, evaluation and methodology papers](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-user-guide/quality-and-methods/index.html \"quality and methods\") were published alongside the first release in July 2012 and have been updated in this release, including a Quality and Methodology Information (QMI) document (152.8 Kb Pdf)\n\n18. The 2011 Census achieved its overall target response rate of 94 per cent of the usually resident population of England and Wales, and over 80 per cent in all local and unitary authorities. The population estimate for England and Wales of 56.1 million is estimated with 95 per cent confidence to be accurate to within +/- 85,000 (0.15 per cent).\n\n19. Details of the policy governing the release of new data are available by visiting [www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html) or from the Media Relations Office email: \u003cmedia.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk\u003e\n\nThese National Statistics are produced to high professional standards and released according to the arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.\n"
